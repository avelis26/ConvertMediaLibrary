# ConvertMediaLibrary

Python scripts to automate converting all h264 videos to h265.

## Question Proposed To ChatGPT:
* Rewrite this script using the ffmpeg submodule instead of subprocess: https://github.com/avelis26/ConvertMediaLibrary/blob/main/Vilicus.py

## ChatGPT Summary
- In this updated version, the ffmpeg-python module is imported and used for probing media files, executing FFmpeg commands, and handling the conversion process. The subprocess module is no longer used.
- Please make sure you have the ffmpeg-python module installed (pip install ffmpeg-python) before running the script.
